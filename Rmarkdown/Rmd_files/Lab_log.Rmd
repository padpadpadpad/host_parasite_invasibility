### 18/10/2017

- Autoclaved the soil again
- Autoclaved 1 L of DI millicule water
- Autoclaved 1 L of 0.6% soft agar
- Autoclaved a spoon to weigh out soil
- Got some $SBW25\phi2$ from Floh. Around 1 mL at 7.26 x 10^8^.
    - Grow up overnight
    - Transfer 60 µl of bacteria and 10 µl of phage (around 7 x 10 ^6^ pfus) into 6 mL of KB agar
    - Should give a concentration of around 10^8^ phage/mL
    - Done this in triplicate
- Grow up _lacZ_ and _WT_ strains overnight. Should give concentration of around ~10^8^ cells in 60 µl.
  - Do these in triplicate
  - Added 60 µL of frozen overnight culture from first experiment (18/08/2017 _lacZ_ and WT)
  
__Retrospectively work out density of the overnight stocks and phage__

### 19/10/2017

- Put 80g of soil into each 10cm x 10cm microcosm
    - Used autoclaved spoon
    - Placed scale in laminar flow hood (cleaned with ethanol before and after)
- Placed 5 mL (~ 200 µl per microcosm) of _lacZ_ and WT into separate 12 mL centrifuge tubes
    - Centrifuged for 15 minutes at max speed (~4500 r.p.m) on big centrifuge
    - Want to get to 5 mL per microcosm for inoculating (~ 125 mL in total)
    - Resuspended pellet into 2250 µl, vortexed and placed 620 µl, 620 µl and 810 µl into three different falcon tubes
    - Filled these three falcon tubes up to 40 mL, 40 mL and 45 mL respectively
        - This guaranteed the same concentration of sample in each falcon tube
    - Placed 5 mL of _lacZ_ or WT strain into each microcosm
    - Froze (-80 ºC) 900 µl of inoculate in 900 µl of glycerol (25% final concentration)
- In the no phage treatments, we added 5 mL of M9
- Added 5 mL  of phage to phage treatments
    - Place 900 µl of bacteria + phage into three centrifuge tubes
    - Add 100 µl (10%) chloroform into each tube (under fume hood)
    - Vortex rigorously
    - Centrifuge for 2-3 minutes at full speed (minifuge)
    - Take out supernatant and placed in a single tube (took out 800 µl of each tube)
    - Put 40 mL of M9 into 6 tubes
    - Added 400 µl into each tube (~100 fold dilution from the initial stock)
    - Shake each tube and add 5 mL into each microcosm
- Place microcosms into the 26 ºC incubator (Level 1 incubator room)

### 22/10/2017

- setup 2 WT microcosms up for spot assays of phage
- used a crystal from T~0~
- autoclaved 2 L of KB agar. Put in small autoclave
