- Autoclaved the soil again
- Autoclaved 1 L of DI millicule water
- Autoclaved 1 L of 0.6% soft agar
- Autoclaved a spoon to weigh out soil
- Got some $SBW25\phi2$ from Floh. Around 1 mL at 7.26 x 10^8^.
    - Grow up overnight
    - Transfer 60 µl of bacteria and 10 µl of phage (around 7 x 10 ^6^ pfus) into 6 mL of KB agar
    - Should give a concentration of around 10^8^ phage/mL
    - Done this in triplicate
- Grow up _lacZ_ and _WT_ strains overnight. Should give concentration of around ~10^8^ cells in 60 µl.
  - Do these in triplicate
  - Added 6 mL of frozen overnight culture from first experiment (18/08/2017 _lacZ_ and WT)
  
__Retrospectively work out density of the overnight stocks and phage__
